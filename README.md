# notes-config

This is my personal config/setup for taking notes in university. It is based upon two "pillars":

1. I use [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata) in order to change my keyboard layout by holding down `Caps Lock` as it is an otherwise useless key in my opinion.

2. I use the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) editor combined with the [Latex Suite plugin](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-latex-suite) with my own custom snippets.
